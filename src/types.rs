Primitive Types - 
Integers: u8, i8, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64, u128, i128, (number of bits they take in memory) -  i32 most common
                       u - no negative value               i - postive or negative

Boolean: (bool)
Characters: (char) - one character 
Tuples
Arrays - fixed length
